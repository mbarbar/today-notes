# today.sh

Shell script to take notes/journal.
Running `today.sh` will open a file named after the current date for editing, creating it if it does not exist.
My usage is to run the script in a dedicated directory where I can quickly take notes without messing with file names.

Only requires some basic UNIX tools.
